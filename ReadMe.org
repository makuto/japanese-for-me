* License
The repository itself is under the MIT license.

Tatoeba corpus licensing details are available [[https://tatoeba.org/eng/terms_of_use#section-6][here]]. They vary per-sentence in license, so I will assume attribution is required per-sentence (which is the most restrictive license they have).
